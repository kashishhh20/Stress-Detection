This project implements a Stress Detection System using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning algorithms to analyze textual data and classify stress levels.
The system preprocesses text data by removing noise such as URLs, punctuation, and stopwords, and applies stemming to reduce words to their root forms. It utilizes a Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifier to classify text into two categories: "No Stress" and "Stress".
